# Tiva-C-NRF24L01P
This is an NRF24L01+ radio tranciever library for Tiva C microcontrollers.

It is mostly a port of the RF24 Arduino Library (https://github.com/TMRh20/RF24) but written in regular C.
This library requires tivaware tools available from the TI website.

So far this has only been tested to work on the Texas Instruments TM4C123 microcontroller family.

This is currently under development and some things may still not work.
